* `powershell-shorthand.csv` - This is a translation csv between powershell verbose command operators like `Write-Output` and `echo`. These translations can be seen with the `Get-Alias` Command ie: `Get-Alias -Name echo`

## Reference

* A Token version of the `powershell-shorthand` is available here: https://github.com/Kriegel/BeautyOfPower but it is *not* a minifier.
